## Eslint

ESLint is an open source project that helps you find and fix problems with your JavaScript code. It doesn't matter if you're writing JavaScript in the browser or on the server,
with or without a framework, ESLint can help your code live its best life.

## Usage

Create a new file called `eslint.config.(m|c)js` and insert the code below:

```javascript
import config from '@x-spacy/eslint-config';

export default config;
```
